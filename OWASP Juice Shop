When attacking a website in burpsuite that are vulnerable to SQL injection
You can intercept the traffic in burp and change the email to ' or 1=1-- 
Which basically makes the statement true because 1=1 and then the -- comments out
anything the system tries to reply to it.
you can also try putting their email benny@juice-sh.op-- Which will make the email true and then
comment out anything that comes after.

You can use Intruder in Burp to Brute force logins
If you get to the rquest where you have login information and replace the password
with §§ you can go back into Burp and put a wordlist as the payload to brute force

Poison Null Bytes are adding %00 into the url to bypass download resrictions.
In this example we were trying to download a json.bak file and we could only download .md or .pdf
to bypass this in the url we changed it from /package.json.bak to /package.json.bak%2500.md
so everything after the %2500 gets nulled out which makes this work.  You need tyo change the url ito url encoded 
format which is how you get the %2500
