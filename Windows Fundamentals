Windows uses NTFS (New Technology File System) for their file system, they uised to use FAT16/32 (File Allocation Table).
Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a file attribute for NTFS
  -ADS are typically hidden and used alot in malware but its not walways bad
  -You can use 3rd party executables or Powershell to see ADS files.
