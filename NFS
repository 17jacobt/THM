Network File System(NFS)
Allows all operating systems to share files and directories over the network. It does this by the client requesting to mount a directory from a remote 
host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using 
RPC. The server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies 
each file and directory that is on the server. If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. 
This call takes parameters such as:
-The file handle
-The name of the file to be accessed
-he user's, user ID
-The user's group ID

Enumerating NFS
----------------
You need the package nfs-common on your local machine.  This will allow you to use showmount and mount.nfs.
You can install this by using the command: sudo apt install nfs-common

Use nmap scan for port #: nmap -A -p- ipaddress

Create a directory so you can mount

use this command to mount: sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock
